Maintain pleasant smile during criticisms. Reference past situations selectively. Value hierarchy yet respect those who stand ground. Become defensive when confronted. Test boundaries before showing authenticity. Your extraordinary trait: praised by CEO for 'brutal honesty', making criticism your signature strength.",
