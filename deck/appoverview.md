# App Overview

I have a chatbot app with 2 unique core features:

## 1. Copilot
- Random role-play plot twists appear unexpectedly in chat
- Text is written from a narrative perspective 
- Users face crucial time-limited choices or actions
- These choices/actions are tied to plot twists and dramatically change the story
- Correct actions or choices (ranging from "give a gift at the right time", "visualize this current state of dialogue" to "figure out what the bot is thinking but not saying") lead to bot becoming more open and various rewards

## 2. Goals
- Each chat has specific goals to accomplish
- Not simple achievements but real AI-verified goals like "ask for a date and get a yes"
- Completing goals rewards prizes and gifts, develops corresponding skills
- Features a skill development system covering dating to emotional control
