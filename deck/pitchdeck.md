[whatToSayOnSlide]
<!--
People Skills Development is BROKEN. 73% of young people struggle socially.
Think asking for a raise and not knowing how to start. Or a first date with someone you really like, those awkward silences.
There's no easy way to track progress on it or get feedback.
With Finesse, there is no need to choose between boring courses or awkward real-life practice. Not anymore.

MORE TO TUNE

- [ ] **Фокус на экономике стартапа.** Инвесторы обращают внимание на юнит-экономику, LTV, CAC, ретеншен, маржинальность.
- [ ] **Понимание рынка.** Важно не просто показывать рост, но и понимать свою нишу, конкурентов и перспективы масштабирования.
- [ ] **Подготовка к фандрайзингу.** Важно заранее думать о путях монетизации, стратегическом росте и вариантах выхода.
- [ ] **Позиционирование и маркетинг.** Четкое понимание, почему клиенты выбирают ваш продукт, помогает быстрее масштабироваться.
- [ ] **Глобальная стратегия.** Фаундеры должны осознавать, как их стартап будет выглядеть через 3-5 лет и какие рынки станут ключевыми.
