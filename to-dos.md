What needs to happen to get this launched

1. Add a backend for
- User account
- Stats
- Saving of cases / transcripts / performance
- Access to prebuilt templates

2. Add Auth, user accounts and payments
3. Create prod server (and later a dev server)
4. Decide on product direction:
- IBD / Consulting case interviews
- Generate a conversation case from scratch
    - Creates a goal
    - Creates personna
    - Narrative context
    - Have these be adjustable by the user via a tab, but they're auto generated when you kick off

5. Improve prompt so it generates a high quality case
6. Find a visual that's better than the AI generated images
7. Think through the UI and UX
